To improve our package and that it has the minimum requirements to be so, we will do the following:
We will create a good README.md where we will explain what our package will do, that is, all our documentation, and this must also be in English.
We must also connect it to a github repository
npm init now we will see that it is already linked to a repository, in the same way we can see this information in the package.json
